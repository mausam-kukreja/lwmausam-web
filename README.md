# Learn with Mausam (lwmausam-web)

Welcome to **Learn with Mausam** — an open, inclusive, and modern learning platform designed to help software engineers, DevOps practitioners, cloud architects, and tech enthusiasts sharpen their skills and grow together as a community.

## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Mausam Kukreja**, a software engineering leader with over 15 years of experience building web, mobile, and cloud-native platforms at scale. I've led engineering teams, designed microservices architectures, and driven cloud-first transformations across startups and enterprises.

Now, I'm channeling that experience into something bigger — building a hands-on learning platform and community that reflects how engineers actually grow: through projects, systems thinking, and shared knowledge.

## 🌱 Mission

**Learn with Mausam** is not just a course-selling site — it's a learning ecosystem:

- 👨‍🏫 Real mentors, real stories, and practical systems
- 🎯 Hands-on microlearning backed by credits and incentives
- 🔁 A community-first platform that grows with its contributors

We're here to enable the next generation of engineers to learn in public, build real projects, and challenge the traditional education model.
